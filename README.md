# FPGA Design and Implementation of a Digital Clock

The design is prototype on the DE1-SoC board and is driven by the 50 MHz clock signal. 

The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds on the seven-segment displays.

The specifications of the design are
*  Hours are displayed on HEX5 and HEX4.
*  Minutes are displayed on HEX3 and HEX2.
*  Seconds are displayed on HEX1 and HEX0.
*  The values on the switches are mirrored on the red LEDs to make it easier to see what time you are about to set.
*  The clock displays times from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59, and will roll the digits over properly.
*  KEY(0) will asynchronously reset the clock to 00:00:00.
*  KEY(2) will asynchronously set the hour to the time currently set on switches SW(7 downto 0) and reset the seconds to zero.
*  KEY(3) will asynchronously set the minutes to the time currently set on switches SW(7 downto 0) and reset the seconds to zero.
